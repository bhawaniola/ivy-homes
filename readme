#  Fetching names with Rotating Proxies , Multiple APIs calls in Parallel & Continuous Progress Save

This project extracts unique names using an autocomplete API with rotating proxies. It ensures continuous execution, saves progress, and resumes even after a restart.

## Features
- **Rotating Proxies**: Uses multiple proxies to avoid rate limits.
- **Progress Saving**: Automatically saves progress and resumes if stopped.
- **Error Handling & Retrying**: Retries failed requests and switches proxies if needed.
- **Efficient Parallel Processing**: Uses multiple workers for faster extraction.
